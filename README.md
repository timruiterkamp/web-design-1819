# Web Design @cmda-minor-web 1819

Making a usable product for Marie, who has been deaf from her birth. In these weeks I am going to create a talk show video provided by great closed captions that will be great to read for Marie.

## Week 1

In the first week it was mostly looking at examples and what is possible with different technologies. There are multiple options, you could add a VTT file to the HTML5 video or implement text directly in the video with something like premiere pro.

The closed captions are quite limited, you can change the positions, default font sizes, background color of the text and font families. But with premiere pro or after effects you could create more meaningfull experiences like create bounces on the way people knock on the door. This would eventually take a lot more work but also provides the video with meaninfull experiences.
